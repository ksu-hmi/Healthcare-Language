    "\n",
    "For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the \"flutter\" tool itself. This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the \"flutter upgrade\" command).\n",

    "### Beautiful user experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being\n",
    "forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.\n",
    "Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the\n",
    "screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate\n",
    "graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full\n",

    "### Fast results\n",
    "\n",
    "Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated 2D graphics\n",
    "library that underpins Chrome and Android: [Skia]. We architected Flutter to\n",
    "support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.\n",
    "Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables\n",
    "compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well\n",
    "as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.\n",

    "plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter\n",
    "provides [thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development,\n",
