# Heathcare-Language
This code will create an app that allows users to input common medical terminology and receive output that is easy to understand for normal, non-healthcare individuals.  

This project will be useful because most people do not understand general medical terminology used in the healthcare setting and hospital staff do not always have the time to sit and explain everything to the patient.  Also, receiving a lot of information at once can be overwhelming and questions may not come until later, when the patient has had time to sit and think about what they were told.

Useful contributions include commonly used medical terminology and abbreviations to make understanding a diagnosis and/or procedure easier and less stressful.
