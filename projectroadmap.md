One example I found for my project can be viewed at : https://github.com/imantsm/medical_abbreviations
In this project, the user has made excel files breaking down medical abbreviations by letter range and made them searchable for users.

Another example is found at : https://github.com/Moozzaart23/Medical-Expert-System
In this project, the user has made text files of different medical conditions and their explainations, a file for the disease symptoms, and a file for the disease treatment.

This code has nothing to do with medical terminology, but the code setup can easily be adapted to fit the need for medical needs
